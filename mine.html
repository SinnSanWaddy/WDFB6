  For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself.

<pre align="center">
We broke up a month ago
Your friends aren't mine, you know, I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was attached
For all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind, she probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hope you're happy, just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

  <pre align="center">
    I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
It’s hard for me to blame you when you were already lost
Oh, yeah
I'm tired of always waiting
Oh, yeah, yeah
I see you changed your number, that's why you don’t get my calls
I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah
I really gotta face it
Oh, yeah, yeah
 
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me?
Now I'm all alone, cryin' ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (All because of you)
 
Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down
To colour me blue
Hate to see you with someone new
I’ll put a curse on her and you
Ain’t no looking back, now you're dead and gone
My love is gone too
 
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is gone
Now you’re dead and gone
 
All my love is gone and the hate has grown
Standing all alone and I'm searching for something
But I can't feel nothing
I pack my bags and go
This don't feel like home
Too much darkness for a rainbow, I feel so used
How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse, yeah
 
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we’re already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me?
Now I'm all alone, cryin' ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (All because of you)
 
Another story that's sad and true

My love is gone too
 
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is gone
Now you're dead and gone

      To you... yes, my love to you
Yes my love to you you, to you
私は私 貴方は貴方と
昨夜言ってた そんな気もするわ
グレイのジャケットに
見覚えがある コーヒーのしみ
相変らずなのね
ショーウィンドウに 二人映れば
Stay with me...
真夜中のドアをたたき
帰らないでと泣いた
あの季節が 今 目の前
Stay with me...
口ぐせを言いながら
二人の瞬間を抱いて
まだ忘れず 大事にしていた
恋と愛とは 違うものだよと
昨夜言われた そんな気もするわ
二度目の冬が来て
離れていった貴方の心
ふり返ればいつも
そこに 貴方を感じていたの
Stay with me...
真夜中のドアをたたき
心に穴があいた
あの季節が 今 目の前
Stay with me...
淋しさまぎらわして
置いたレコードの針
同じメロディ 繰り返していた...
Stay with me...
真夜中のドアをたたき
帰らないでと泣いた
あの季節が 今 目の前
Stay with me...
口ぐせを言いながら
二人の瞬間を抱いて
まだ忘れず 暖めてた
Stay with me...
真夜中のドアをたたき
帰らないでと泣いた
あの季節が 今 目の前
Stay with me...
